# A scrolling platforming game.

work in progress. 

As of the writing of this readme, this game only consists of:
- a physics engine (including a jumping mechanism that allows you to charge your jump for greater height)
- attack mechanism (inc. hitboxes)
- self-generating platforms
- a sprite for the main player
- a health bar
- boundaries for the player not to cross (eg left wall)(lives -= 1 if collided with player)
- a simple menu that pauses all actions of the game (can be unpaused)(toggled with ESC key)
- short invincibility period uopn being hit (shown by a forcefield sprite)

Yet to develop:
- parry mechanism
- more enemies (and their AI)
